## What is this mod about
Well, the name says it all, it adds a Horse Armor Stand and just like with the classic armor stand in vanilla, you can display your favorite horse armor.

It should work with no problem with any mods, that add vanilla-looking (without fancy models) armor to the game.

If you like it â€” **download** it, and if you are happy with it, **follow** for more updates.
